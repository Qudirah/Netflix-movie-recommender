## ðŸ’¡ About This Project

This project was created during the **Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC)** **Build with AI** event â€” a dynamic, hands-on session where participants explored the exciting intersection of artificial intelligence and real-world use cases.

I was invited to speak and build a mini AI-powered solution, and in under 30 minutes, we developed a working **movie recommendation system** using:

- **Pandas** and **scikit-learn** for data handling and similarity computation
- **Pickle** for saving precomputed similarity matrices
- **Streamlit** for the web interface
- A splash of âœ¨ enthusiasm + caffeine

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. The app uses a dataset of movies and extracts relevant features like genres, keywords, cast, and crew.
2. It vectorizes this information using **TF-IDF** and calculates **cosine similarity** between movies.
3. When a user selects a movie, the app recommends the top 5 most similar titles.
